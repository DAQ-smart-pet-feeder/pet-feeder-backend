# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate # macOS and Linux
env\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows
```
then, Generate server stubs for python-flask from openapi/rain-
api.yaml with [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io) or

OpenAPI Generator and Put them inside stub folder

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m swagger_server
python app.py
openapi-to-graphql openapi/pet-feeder-api.yaml
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/pet-feeder-api/v3/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/pet-feeder-api/v3/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
